# common-hosting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/common-theory/common-hosting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/common-theory/common-hosting)

The smart contract api for providing ipfs pinning services for a flat wei/second fee. This is combined with the [`common-hosting-server`](https://github.com/common-theory/common-hosting-server), which adds txt verified domains to the local ipfs storage.

The [`common-hosting-dapp`](https://github.com/common-theory/common-hosting-dapp) should be used for purchasing domain hosting time in the common and viewing statistics about the current common contract.
